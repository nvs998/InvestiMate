      "Should I invest in gold through Sovereign Gold Bonds or buy physical gold this year? | Mint\n",
      "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced the 10th tranche of the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) scheme, which will be open for subscription from January 3 to January 7. The SGBs are a popular investment option among Indians, especially those who want to invest in gold without buying physical bullion.\n",
      "However, with the prices of gold rising over the past few years, many investors are wondering whether they should invest in gold through SGBs or buy physical gold this year. Here's a comparison between the two options:\n",
      "Why invest in gold?\n",
      "Gold is considered a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation. It also provides a diversification benefit to an investment portfolio as its price tends to move inversely to other assets like stocks and bonds.\n",
      "What are Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)?\n",
      "SGBs are government-backed bonds that allow individuals to invest in gold by purchasing them at a fixed price. The RBI issues these bonds on behalf of the government, and their tenure can range from one to eight years.\n",
      "Key features of SGBs:\n",
      "1. Price: The price of SGBs is linked to the market price of gold, but it's capped at ₹50,000 per investor.\n",
      "2. Interest rate: SGBs offer an interest rate of 2.5% per annum, which is paid quarterly.\n",
      "3. Lock-in period: There's a lock-in period of five years, after which you can redeem your SGBs.\n",
      "4. Tax benefits: SGBs are exempt from capital gains tax, and the interest earned is taxable.\n",
      "Pros of investing in SGBs:\n",
      "1. Liquidity: You can sell your SGBs before the maturity date, but you'll have to pay a penalty if you do so within the first five years.\n",
      "2. Low risk: Since SGBs are backed by the government, there's minimal risk involved.\n",
      "3. No storage costs: Unlike physical gold, you don't need to worry about storing your SGBs.\n",
      "Cons of investing in SGBs:\n",
      "1. Limited flexibility: You're locked into holding the SGBs for five years, unless you're willing to pay a penalty.\n",
      "2. Returns may not match physical gold: If gold prices rise significantly during the lock-in period, you might earn lower returns compared to buying physical gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's compare the returns on SGBs with buying physical gold:\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming you invest ₹50,000 in SGBs, here's how much you'd get at the end of the lock-in period (five years):\n",
      "\n",
      "* ₹50,000 + ₹12,500 (interest) = ₹62,500\n",
      "\n",
      "If you had invested the same amount in physical gold, you could have bought around 0.75 kg of gold at ₹45,000 per gram (the current price). At the end of five years, assuming the price remains constant, you would\n"
