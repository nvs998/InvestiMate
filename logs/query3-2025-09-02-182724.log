normal answer=========== Should I switch from Asian Paints to Berger Paints based on recent quarterly results?
Answer: It is not recommended to make a decision solely based on recent quarterly results as there are many factors that can affect a company's performance. It is important to consider other factors such as the company's long-term growth prospects, market share, financial stability, and product quality before making a decision.
