normal answer=========== Should I allocate more to equity or debt in my portfolio if I’m planning to buy a house in 10 years?
Answer: It depends on your financial situation and risk tolerance. If you have a stable income and can afford to take on more risk, allocating more to equity may be a good option as it has the potential for higher returns over the long term. However, if you have significant debt or are close to retirement, you may want to consider a more conservative allocation with a greater emphasis on debt. It's important to consult with a financial advisor to determine the best course of action for your individual circumstances.
